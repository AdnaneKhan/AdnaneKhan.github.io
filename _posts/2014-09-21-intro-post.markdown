I'm creating this blog to serve a few purposes:

* Personal Resume Site
* Project logs: these will be blog posts that will describe the projects that I have done in class or outside of class. I will discuss what I found interesting, what I thought was difficult, what I ended up making, and why I did what I did.

I will not be able to post source code for many of the school projects due to academic integrity.

* Personal blog for non-tech topics: I eat a gluten free and dairy free diet. Occasionally when I have time I like to cook and experiment with what I can make while conforming to my restrictions. I may or may not also talk about random things I find interesting.
