I'm a motivated student who is passionate about a wide range of technologies.

These days topics my interest as been piqued by virtual reality. I am hoping to buy an Oculus Rift once I graduate to tinker with in my spare time.

For hobbies I enjoy exercising and looking up foods that I can cook. I eat a gluten free and dairy free diet so cooking is a very important part of my life.
